What is AutoMapper in C# ?

The AutoMapper in C# is a mapper between two objects. It is an Object-to-Object Mapper and it maps the properties of two different objects by transforming the input object of one type to the output object of another type.

In Automapper , we will have  a Source Object (Ex: Employee Class) and a Destination Object (Ex: EmployeeDTO class).

Automapper will map the properties from the source object to the destination object.

Install the "AutoMapper" package from the nuget package manager.
