Why do we need AutoMapper in C# ?

Let us understand why we need Auto mapper in C# with an example.
Let us say we have the following two classes Employee and EmployeeDTO.
First, create a class file with the name Employee.cs and
then copy and paste the following code into it. This is a very simple class having 4 properties.
namespace AutoMapperDemo
{
	public class Employee
	{

		public string Name {get; set; }
		public int Salary {get; set; }
		public string Address {get; set; }
		public string Department {get; set;}

	}
}


Next, create another class file with the name EmployeeDTO,— and then copy and paste the following
code into it, This class is identical to the Employee class having 4 properties.
namespace AutoMapperDemo
{
	public class EmployeeDTO
	{

		public string Name { get; set; }
		public int Salary { get; set; }
		public string Address { get; set; }
		public string Department { get; set; }

	}

}

Our business requirement is to copy the data or transfer the data from Employee object to the EmployeeDTO object.

In the traditional approach (without the AutoMapper) , first we need to create and populate the Employee object.

Project 1 : Presentation Layer (Web,iOS etc)

Project 2 : API / (Business Logic)

Project 3: Data Access Layer (database)


Suppose from DAL to Proj2 (BAL) we are returning a class with 10 property and in the API we need the 10 property to do some operations but the API response should contain only 5 or 7 properties from the main model class.

It is hectic to manually copy values as in the traditional way and there comes the use case of Automapper.
